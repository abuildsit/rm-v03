# RemitMatch Workflow Documentation Package

## Overview

This comprehensive documentation package contains production-ready code examples, integration guides, and troubleshooting resources for RemitMatch's two core workflows: **OpenAI Document Extraction** and **Invoice Matching**. 

The documentation is designed for external development teams who want to understand, adapt, or implement similar workflows in their own applications.

## Workflows Included

### 1. OpenAI Document Extraction Workflow

**Purpose**: Extract structured data from PDF documents using OpenAI's Assistant API

**Key Features**:
- Production-ready OpenAI Assistant integration
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- File validation and preprocessing
- Structured JSON response validation
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Use Cases**:
- Remittance processing
- Invoice data extraction
- Purchase order processing
- Financial document analysis
- Any structured document parsing

### 2. Invoice Matching Workflow

**Purpose**: Match payment data against invoice records using progressive normalization

**Key Features**:
- Three-pass matching strategy (Exact → Relaxed → Numeric)
- O(1) performance with lookup tables
- Comprehensive normalization functions
- Batch processing and database integration
- Detailed matching statistics and reporting

**Use Cases**:
- Payment reconciliation
- Invoice matching
- Order fulfillment tracking
- Document correlation
- Financial record matching

## Technical Specifications

### Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Async/await support
- Database system (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- OpenAI API access (for extraction workflow)

#### Dependencies
```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install openai pydantic asyncio uuid decimal httpx

# Optional for enhanced features
pip install structlog psutil python-dotenv
```

### Architecture Principles

Both workflows follow these design principles:

1. **Async-First**: Built with asyncio for high concurrency
2. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
3. **Performance Optimized**: O(1) lookups, batch processing, connection pooling
4. **Type Safe**: Full Pydantic model validation
5. **Monitoring Ready**: Structured logging and performance metrics
6. **Database Agnostic**: Adaptable to different database systems
7. **Production Ready**: Used in live RemitMatch systems
