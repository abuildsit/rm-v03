## Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to .tasks/todo.md. Use the console the get the current date-time, and have a prefix of YYMMDDHHMM on each file, and give it a relevant name < 10 char
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off '[ ]' as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Create a feature/ branch to work on.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way give me a high level explanation of what changes you made, and always mark commpleted tasks/sub-tasks as '[x]' 
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

6. If you are making any UI changes, use the puppeteer MCP to take a screenshot of the exact page / component before and after the change to confirm success / that you haven't broken other things.

7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Once you are confident the code is functioning, and you are proud of the standard of work you have delivered, create a pull request.
